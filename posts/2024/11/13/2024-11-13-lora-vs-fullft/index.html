The paper shows that the two methods are not equivalent.</p> <p>Fine-tuned models generalize outside the adaptation task’s distribution but LoRA might have some problems with this. LoRA has <strong>intruder dimensions</strong>, as called by the authors, that are not seen in the full fine-tuning. LoRA with intruder dimensions might achieve comparable performance to full fine-tuning but when used with multiple tasks the performance drops.</p> <p><strong>LoRA and full fine-tuning use different subspaces of the weight matrix.</strong></p> <p>LoRA and full fiine-tuning have differences in neuron’s angle and magnitude (Liu et al., 2024).</p> <div class="language-bibtex highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">Shih-Yang Liu, Chien-Yi Wang, Hongxu Yin, Pavlo Molchanov, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang, KwangTing Cheng, and Min-Hung Chen.
