The paper was presented at NeurIPS 2022. The paper can be found <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/c3ba4962c05c49636d4c6206a97e9c8a-Paper-Conference.pdf">here</a>.</p> <h1 id="first-pass">First Pass</h1> <ol> <li><strong>What is the problem?</strong> The paper investigates how to quantize the attention mechanism in transformers to 8-bit precision.</li> <li><strong>Why is it important?</strong> Quantizing the attention mechanism in transformers to 8-bit precision can reduce the memory footprint and computational cost of transformers.</li> </ol> <h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3> <p>An llm quantization method with in8 matrix multiplication. Memory required for inference is reduced by half. The most interesting part for me is that the authors state that there are <strong>emergent features</strong> in transformers. They use vector-wise quantization to quantize the attention mechanism in transformers. Most importantly, for the emergent features they use a different way of decomposing the attention mechanism.</p> <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3> <p>The feed-forward and attention layers with their matrix multiplication operations make up the 95% of the parameters and 65-85% of the computation for large transformer language models (For LLMs with &gt;= 6.7B parameters) (Ilharco et al., 2020).</p> <p>First multi-billion scale Int8 quantization procedure.</p> <ul> <li>32-bit weights to 8-bit weights</li> </ul> <p>With vector-wise quantization the method retains performance up to 2.7B parameters. Beyond 6.7B parameters emergence of extreme outliers in the feature dimensions during inference, making up 0.1% of all input features. Zeroing these features out decreases top-1 attention softmax probability mass by more than 20%, and affects validation perplexity by 600-1000%.</p> <p>To compensate for these outliers the paper performs 16-bit matrix multiplication on the outliers, and vector-wise quantization on the rest of the features (99.9%).</p> <h3 id="broader-impacts">Broader Impacts</h3> <p>Making LLMs more accessible for future research. This could lead to both positive and negative impacts.</p> <h1 id="second-pass">Second Pass</h1> <h3 id="background">Background</h3> <p>High-precision asymmetric quantization (zeropoint quantization): high precision by using the full bit-range but is rarely used in practice due to the high memory and computational cost. Scaling with the normalized dynamic range and then shifting by the zeropoint.</p> <p>Symmetric quantization (absolute maximum quantization): the most commonly used technique. Dividing by the infinity norm and multiplying by 127. Values in [-127, 0) are not used.</p> <h3 id="int8-matrix-multiplicatiobn-at-scale-method-of-the-paper">Int8 Matrix Multiplicatiobn at Scale (Method of the paper)</h3> <p>Main challenge: quantization methods use a single scaling constant per tensor, an outlier could reduce precision.</p> <h4 id="vector-wise-quantization">Vector-wise Quantization</h4> <p>View matrix multiplication as a sequence of independent inner products.</p> <p>Hidden States: ( X_{f16} \in \mathbb{R}^{b \times h} ) Weight Matrix: ( W_{f16} \in \mathbb{R}^{h \times o} )</p> <p>Assign scaling constant ( c_{x_{f16}} ) to each row of ( X_{f16} ) and ( c_w ) to each row of ( W_{f16} ).</p> <p>Dequantize by: ( \frac{1}{c_{x_{f16}}c_{w{f16}}}).</p> <h4 id="references">References</h4> <div class="language-bibtex highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nc">@article</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">dettmers2022gpt3</span><span class="p">,</span>

The first pass is to get a general idea of what the paper is about. The second pass is to understand the details of the paper. The third pass is to understand the paper in depth.</p> <p>For this particular paper I did only the first pass because I wanted to understand the general idea of the paper.</p> <h1 id="first-pass">First Pass</h1> <ol> <li><strong>What is the problem?</strong> The paper investigates what BERT attends to when making predictions.</li> <li><strong>Why is it important?</strong> Understanding what BERT or any other language model attends to is important as it can help us understand how these models <strong>reason</strong>.</li> </ol> <h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3> <p>Previous work focused on:</p> <ul> <li>Model outputs (final layer of the model)</li> <li>Internal vector representations (this could be the hidden states of the model)</li> </ul> <p>BERT’s attention heads focused on:</p> <ul> <li>Delimeter tokens (e.g. [CLS], [SEP])</li> <li>Some positional offsets, meaning that the attention heads are not just focusing on the token itself but also on the tokens around it.</li> <li>Or broadly on the entire sentence.</li> </ul> <p>Some attention heads reflected already known linguistic phenomena:</p> <ul> <li>e.g. attention heads that focused on objects of verbs, coreference, etc.</li> </ul> <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3> <p>The paper proposed different methods to understand attention.</p> <p>They state that in the attention maps linguistic knowledge can be found. They do something called <strong>probing attention maps</strong> to understand what the attention heads are focusing on.</p> <p>So I believe the paper shown that BERT reflects linguistic phenomena in its attention heads. This is a very revealing insight into how BERT works.</p> <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3> <p>Heads learn different types of information, in this case linguistic information. Language models like BERT by training on unlabeled data inherently learns linguistic information, thus there is no need for explicit linguistic features.</p> <h4 id="references">References</h4> <div class="language-bibtex highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nc">@article</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">clark2019does</span><span class="p">,</span>
